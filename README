GRABBY HANDS
============

SUMMARY
-------
A simple read-only JVM Kestrel client optimized for consuming logical
queues hosted across multiple Kestrel instances. Connections are
opened to each Kestrel for each requested queue and messages are
read via blocking reads. Implemented in Scala, but callable from
Java.

GOALS
-----
Robustness, visibility, efficiency, low-latency.

NON-GOALS
---------
A complete implementation of the memcache protocol.

Scala Actors.

FEATURES
--------
Highly-concurrent.

Multiple Kestrel clusters can be supported by creating multiple
instances of GrabbyHands.

Arbitrary user-defined read and write timeout behaviors are possible
by interacting directly with a Blocking Queue.
