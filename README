GRABBY HANDS
============

PRERELEASE 2010/02/18

SUMMARY
-------
A simple read-only JVM Kestrel client optimized for consuming logical
queues hosted across multiple Kestrel instances. Connections are
opened to each Kestrel for each requested queue and messages are
read via blocking reads. Implemented in Scala, but callable from
Java.

GOALS
-----
Robustness, visibility, efficiency, low-latency.

NON-GOALS
---------
A complete implementation of the memcache protocol.

Scala Actors.

FEATURES
--------
Highly-concurrent.

Multiple Kestrel clusters can be supported by creating multiple
instances of GrabbyHands.

Arbitrary user-defined read and write timeout behaviors are possible
by interacting directly with a Blocking Queue.

TESTS
-----
All tests assume a kestrel process running on localhost:22133.

% ant test runs the normal tests that are run during ant package.
% ant stress will run a small stress test suite and give some performance numbers.
% ant javatest will run the java example.
